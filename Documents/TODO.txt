This is not a complete list, and will be updated as I think of things and transcribe my notes from other places

IDEAS ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

- Randomize unknown's base stats
- Add some ??? type attack moves to the game
	- Mystery Power: 60 power ??? move, random chance of a randomly chosen stat buff/debuff or special condition
	- Unknown Power: 75-80 power ??? move, random chance of a randomly chosen stat buff/debuff or special condition
	- Cryptic Power: 30 power ???, chance of weirder effects like multi-hit, much higher chance of multiple effects
	- Strange power: 30-90 power, ??? random target (higher chance of weird targets)
	- Enigma: 1-150 power, ???, low chance of any bonus effect
- Gym / Leader Overhaul
	- Make gym leader TM based on type and make sure their pokemon know it (if applicable)
	- Add option to randomize gym type
	- Add option to shuffle gym leaders (like wattson could become gym 1, etc)
		- Add option to include rivals, elite4, etc in pool
		- Add option to take characters from other same-gen roms (firered gym leaders, etc)
	- Place hints in trainer and sign dialog about upcoming gym info and / location of cool items
- Improve Impossible Evo fix and evo levels
	- Add an option to change slowbro / slowking and huntail / gorebyss to friendship day / night or stones
	- Change new evolution stone item descriptions to say that also make pokemon evolve
	- Item remapping
		- event items (scanner and steven event especially) // needs verification
- Trainer / Event Ideas
	- Champion randomization (the champion could be Brendan/May, wally, or any other reoccuring / special trainer in the game or that is added)
	- Extra reoccuring trainers (you might encounter youngster joey multiple times throughout the game, etc)
	- Ambushes (Events that trigger when you reach certain places like rival battle)
		- Could be more rival / wally battles, or an extra reocurring trainer	
	- Add more Wally Battles
	- Randomize Rival Battle Locations
	- (Em/Ru/Sap - Add a final rival battle before victory road or something)
	- Secret Agents (any non-trainer NPC may become a trainer)
		- Allow limiters that when removed can extend this to pokemon centers, etx
	- Difficulty: Trainers use held items
	- Trainers can use battle items?
- Catching Tut ideas
	- Make the catching tut pokemon that wally is given the unevolved form of a pokemon that normal actually has in battle
- Learnset Randomization
	- Add other options for level choosing alg (specifically just power, intelligent, or totally random)
	- Add other move choosing options (from TM compats, from STAB, from Status, from Damaging, from a moveset of a pokemon of the same type)
- Improve Moveset Generation
	- Ability-based synergies for smart moveset generation (get sunny day if you have chlorophil, etc)
	- Stat-based synergies (prefer moves that suit your attack stats)
	- Make trainer smeargles have random movesets or premade fun ones
- Make procedurally generated battle sequences retain moves from previous levels
	- Keep TM moves fairly consistant
	- If pokemon learned something on a lower evolution, have the option to keep that (esp. for dunsparse plague)
- Remap pokemon in procedurally generated battle sequences (maps pokemon to certain pokemon in the base sequence)
- Trainer Randomization
	- Trainer Type Theming (class / gym - based)?
	- Trainer one-to-one species randomization (a trainer with three magikarps will have 3 of the same pokemon
	- Allow moveset generation selection
- Wild Pokemon Randomization
	- Area Type theming (Forest likely to have grass / bug etc)
	- Encounter Bank Type theming (prefer water in fishing spots, etc)
	- Encounter Bank habitat theming (FRLG have a habitat attribute in the pokedex. an encounter bank's base habitat can be taken from the majorite habitat of pokemon that are encountered there) (FRLG or Aggregate mode only)
	- Encounter Bank ratio weighting (number of times that pokemon appears in that encounter slot in the input ROM)
- TM Compat Randomization
	- Intelligent - use original TM / MT learn type ratios to guide new move choices
	- Use a move similarity factor to guide new move choices (I.E if could learn bite, consider crunch, fire fang, etc to be learnable)
	- Preserve noise and normal TMs through evolutionary lines (Possible use data from al pokemon in the line together)
- TM / MT Randomization
	- Rare move setting - Weight move choices inversely proportional to number of occurences in learnsets
	- Move choice weighting (use metrics)
		- Type similarity
		- Power similarity
		- Learn level similarity (maybe need to compare std.dev and average for similarity)
			- Fallback to power learn level if no data
- Pokemon Weighting
	- Choose priority for different heuristics for a category
		- Heuristics can be on the same level
	- Map categories can be for "Routes" (Maps with "Route" in the name) and named maps
- Variant Randomization
	- Palettes:
		- Make the similar color / detection algo just fall back on the the simple color change for now, allow for a different fallback later
	- Typing
		- Disallow all future original types from being new added types
		- Maybe: prevent single type pokemon that evolve into dual-typed pokemon from becoming dual-typed? (or maybe as an option at least)
- Special Pokemon Randomization
	- Setting for legenary pokemon to always be legendary pokemon (when relevant)
- 365 Mode
	- Ensures all pokemon are obtainable in the game
	- Hardcore:
		- To obtain all pokemon, you must do all in-game trades, special events (like mew), obtain all gift pokemon, and baby pokemon must be obtained from breeding or gift eggs
- Dream Team:
	- Pokemon are given to the player in poke balls in the starting town
	- Pokemon are optionally given to the player as in-game trades in the first town (allowing the player to give custom IV values and nicknames, etc)?
		- May cause boosted exp which could be undesirable (may be some way to reset OT)
- Misc / Minor / Polish
	- Raining routes should auto-water berries
	- Change the devon goods guy's shroomish text into something that is in that area
	- Wally Text Fix ("RALTS" to current pokemon)
	- Allow Text reformatting to put hyphenated words on two separate lines
	- Fire Red: Starter Text replacement
	- Fire Red: Catching tut writing (very low priority, may never add) (maybe add a skip)
	- RSE berry giver randomization (may be possible with script writing) // May already be done, needs verification

FEATURES ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

- FireRed v1.1, LeafGreen v1.0 + v1.1, Sapphire v1.0 + v1.1 + v1.2, and Ruby v1.0 + v1.1 + v1.2 compatibility
	- Test all R/S variant sprites
	- Check R/S special trainers
	- Test how item selection dropdowns work is settings patches saved on different games
- National Pokedex from game start hack
- ROM Data XML export (randomized rom exports its offsets so it can be re-randomized)
	- Include data in a human-readable format
- Item randomization
	- stores
	- vending machines
	- statics / gift items (partially complete)
	- held items
		- wild
		- starter
		- gift
	- Use cost as optional weighting
- Script reading / writing
	- Maps
	- Signs
	- Triggers
- Multi-Rom Data aggregation
	- For instance, use emerald as a base but pull additional classes and moveset updates from FireRed
- Game corner prize randomization
- Egg move writing
- Move description writing
- Move tutor NPC text fix

- Game corner randomization????
	- High stakes roulette
- Money Scaling
- Min moves added randomization support
- UI:
	- ROM / Randomizer info readout. Add to the randomizer tab and make the top part "settings"
		- Name / Code of opened rom
		- Current version
		- Is update availible?
		- Downloads link
	- Dark mode UI
	- Drag rom into application
	- Random Compatibility on chance needs to be more clear (change label based on compatibility option)
- Gen IV compatibility
	- Evolution level calculation for new evo types that don't have an explicit level
	- Catching tut potentially doesn't need to be a male pokemon
	- May need to adapt wally-specific code to support gen IV rivals

CLEANUP /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

- Remove all unecessary manual pointer prefix searches and replace with find offset calls
- Move encounter set reading code out of the encounter set classes to make the model gen-agnostic
- Move Elt name constants into constants class(es)
- Check to see if pkmn base stat offsets point to after the null pokemon
- Make "Size" and other rom data shortcut methods safe to fail with warnings
- Make variants support the ban selfdestruct setting

FIXES ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

- Pokemon that evolve with stones have bad default movesets due to not learning stuff by level up.
	- Still an issue, but fixed in smart moveset generation. Currently no fix for default movesets
- TM Compat and Learnset generation could be dependent on each other
- Potentially: write catching tut on emerald has some differences from clean ROMs (see diff9)
- Fix professor Oak's aides for National Dex mode:

DUMB IDEA CORNER ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

- Smeargle Hell: A certain percentage of moves have their effects replaced with sketch
- Splash Zone: A certain percentage of moves have their effects replaced with but nothing happened
	- Could also be moves in learnsets being replaced by splash
- Nice Brendan Hack: Edits Brendan's lines so he's not a jerk and respects women
- Pay Day mode: Pay gives you fat stacks (maybe no money from trainers)
- Color Splash: X items use moves in battle, your pokemon have shit moves
	- COULD MAKE THIS BE BERRIES OMG
	- Random Berry Effects
	- Just add items that do hella damage
- Make trainer cut-in lines dumb puns (in gen IV)
- No evolution zone: pokemon cannot evolve (will make any pokemon a valid level unless done as a post-process (which could be an option))
- Kaiji mode:
	- no exp from battles, rare candies can be bought at the game corner
- Remove Scott

This is not a complete list, and will be updated as I think of things and transcribe my notes from other places

IDEAS ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

- Randomize unknown's base stats
- Add some ??? type attack moves to the game
	- Start by randomizing Hidden Power
- Gym / Leader Overhaul
	- Make gym leader TM based on type and make sure their pokemon know it (if applicable)
	- Add option to randomize gym type
	- Add option to shuffle gym leaders (like wattson could become gym 1, etc)
		- Add option to include rivals, elite4, etc in pool
		- Add option to take characters from other same-gen roms (firered gym leaders, etc)
	- Place hints in trainer and sign dialog about upcoming gym info and / location of cool items
- Improve Impossible Evo fix and evo levels
	- Add an option to change slowbro / slowking and huntail / gorebyss to friendship day / night or stones
	- Item remapping
		- store items
		- event items (scanner and steven event especially)
- Trainer / Event Ideas
	- Champion randomization (the champion could be Brendan/May, wally, or any other reoccuring / special trainer in the game or that is added)
	- Extra reoccuring trainers (you might encounter youngster joey multiple times throughout the game, etc)
	- Ambushes (Events that trigger when you reach certain places like rival battle)
		- Could be more rival / wally battles, or an extra reocurring trainer	
	- Add more Wally Battles
	- Randomize Rival Battle Locations
	- (Em/Ru/Sap - Add a final rival battle before victory road or something)
	- Secret Agents (any non-trainer NPC may become a trainer)
		- Allow limiters that when removed can extend this to pokemon centers, etx
	- Difficulty: All trainers use good AI
	- Difficulty: Trainers use held items
	- Trainers can use battle items?
- Learnset Randomization
	- Add other options for level choosing alg (specifically just power, intelligent, or totally random)
	- Add other move choosing options (from TM compats, from STAB, from Status, from Damaging, from a moveset of a pokemon of the same type)
- Improve Moveset Generation
	- Ability-based synergies for smart moveset generation (get sunny day if you have chlorophil, etc)
	- Stat-based synergies (prefer moves that suit your attack stats)
	- Make trainer smeargles have random movesets or premade fun ones
- Make procedurally generated battle sequences retain moves from previous levels
	- Keep TM moves fairly consistant
	- If pokemon learned something on a lower evolution, have the option to keep that (esp. for dunsparse plague)
- Remap pokemon in procedurally generated battle sequences (maps pokemon to certain pokemon in the base sequence)
- Trainer Randomization
	- Trainer Type Theming (class / gym - based)?
	- Trainer one-to-one species randomization (a trainer with three magikarps will have 3 of the same pokemon
	- Allow moveset generation selection
- Wild Pokemon Randomization
	- Area Type theming (Forest likely to have grass / bug etc)
	- Encounter Bank Type theming (prefer water in fishing spots, etc)
	- Encounter Bank habitat theming (FRLG have a habitat attribute in the pokedex. an encounter bank's base habitat can be taken from the majorite habitat of pokemon that are encountered there) (FRLG or Aggregate mode only)
	- Encounter Bank ratio weighting (number of times that pokemon appears in that encounter slot in the input ROM)
- TM Compat Randomization
	- Intelligent - record original TM / MT learns and turn those moves on if present
	- Intelligent - use original TM / MT learn type ratios to guide new move choices
	- Use a move similarity factor to guide new move choices (I.E if could learn bite, consider crunch, fire fang, etc to be learnable)
	- Intelligent - potentially keep number to a certain degree (pmkn with no compat stay that way - Magikarp, Wobbufett etc.). Maybe a new setting - IntelligentKeepNumber / NumberAware
	- Preserve noise and normal TMs through evolutionary lines (Possible use data from al pokemon in the line together)
- TM / MT Randomization
	- Rare move setting - Weight move choices inversely proportional to number of occurences in learnsets
	- Move choice weighting (use metrics)
		- Type similarity
		- Power similarity
		- Learn level similarity (maybe need to compare std.dev and average for similarity)
			- Fallback to power learn level if no data
- Misc / Minor
	- Raining routes should auto-water berries
- Pokemon Weighting
	- Choose priority for different heuristics for a category
		- Heuristics can be on the same level
	- Map categories can be for "Routes" (Maps with "Route" in the name) and named maps
- Special Pokemon Randomization
	- Setting for legenary pokemon to always be legendary pokemon (when relevant)
- 365 Mode
	- Ensures all pokemon are obtainable in the game
	- Hardcore:
		- To obtain all pokemon, you must do all in-game trades, special events (like mew), obtain all gift pokemon, and baby pokemon must be obtained from breeding or gift eggs

FEATURES ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

- FireRed v1.1, LeafGreen v1.0 + v1.1, Sapphire v1.0 + v1.11, and Ruby v1.0 + v1.11 compatibility
- Enable for FireRed
	- Starter Text replacement
	- Catching tut writing (very low priority, may never add) (maybe add a skip)
	- Snow weather hack
- National Pokedex from game start hack
- Gen IV compatibility
- Settings preset saving (possibly in JSON or XML)
- ROM Data XML export (randomized rom exports its offsets so it can be re-randomized)
	- Include data in a human-readable format
- Item randomization 
	- pickup items
	- stores
	- vending machines
	- statics / gift items (partially complete)
	- held items
		- wild
		- starter
		- gift
	- Use cost as optional weighting
- RSE berry giver randomization (may be possible with script writing)
- Script reading / writing
	- Maps
	- Signs
	- Triggers
- Dream Team: A feature that allows you to set up a team from the beginning of the game
	- Can choose 6 custom pokemon, or choose parameters to generate a team with
		- So far includes type filters, legendary / illegal evo filters, and TotalBST upper and lower bounds
	- Pokemon are given to the player
		- V1: in the first area
		- V2: in poke balls in the starting town
		- V3: as in-game trades in the first town (allowing the player to give custom IV values and nicknames, etc)?
			- May cause boosted exp which could be undesirable
- TM Text setting
- Multi-Rom Data aggregation
	- For instance, use emerald as a base but pull additional classes and moveset updates from FireRed
- Berry Tree Randomization
- Egg move writing
- Ban selfdestruct works by move effect rather than explicit move number
- Wally Text Fix ("RALTS" to current pokemon)
- HM Compat randomization
	- Settings already there just need randomization
- Game corner randomization????
	- High stakes roulette
- Money Scaling
- UI Hookups
	- Hookup custom starter UI (need a pokemon name to pokemon enum function)

CLEANUP /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

- Remove all unecessary manual pointer prefix searches and replace with find offset calls
- Move encounter set reading code out of the encounter set classes to make the model gen-agnostic
- Move movedata reading code out of the MoveData classes to make the model gen-agnostic
- Move Trainer / Trainerpokemon reading code out of the trainer classes to make the model gen-agnostic
- Move Evolution Reading code out of the Evolution classes to make the model gen agnostic
- Move Elt name constants into constants class(es)
- Check to see if pkmn base stat offsets point to after the null pokemon
- Make "Size" and other rom data shortcut methods safe to fail with warnings
- Make seed settings into a data model / view

FIXES ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

- RUBY AND SAPPHIRE
	- Both don't have move tutors, so these need to be optionally supported
- Pokemon that evolve with stones have bad default movesets due to not learning stuff by level up.
	- Still an issue, but fixed in smart moveset generation. Currently no fix for default movesets
- Snow looks weird in some areas
- TM Compat and Learnset generation could be dependent on each other
- Weird hiker man isn't becoming a double battle
- Potentially: write catching tut on emerald has some differences from clean ROMs (see diff9)

DUMB IDEA CORNER ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

- Smeargle Hell: A certain percentage of moves have their effects replaced with sketch
- Splash Zone: A certain percentage of moves have their effects replaced with but nothing happened
	- Could also be moves in learnsets being replaced by splash
- Nice Brendan Hack: Edits Brendan's lines so he's not a jerk and respects women
- Pay Day mode: Pay gives you fat stacks (maybe no money from trainers)
- Color Splash: X items use moves in battle, your pokemon have shit moves
	- COULD MAKE THIS BE BERRIES OMG
	- Random Berry Effects
	- Just add items that do hella damage
- Make trainer cut-in lines dumb puns (in gen IV)
- No evolution zone: pokemon cannot evolve (will make any pokemon a valid level unless done as a post-process (which could be an option))
- Kaiji mode:
	- no exp from battles, rare candies can be bought at the game corner

# Description

Procedural Pokemon Randomizer is a Pokemon randomizer I'm creating as a fun side project!

- This Randomizer focuses on using procedural generation and weighted random choices to create randomized ROMs that feel more natural
- It also allows you to partially randomize most things. Want to randomize 5% of trainer's pokemon for an experience that is mostly the same but with some surprises? You got it.

- Some of my favorite new features are:
	- Intelligent trainer pokemon choices: Challenge runs are more fun when you can plan for a fisherman to usually have WATER pokemon!
	- Intelligent wild pokemon choices: Find pokemon where they make sense (water pokemon when fishing, electric pokemon in the power plant, etc)!
	- Reoccuring trainer generation: trainers that you see multiple times (like rivals, etc.) will raise a team that keeps members but grows and evolves over the course of the game
	- Battle type randomization: randomize the battle type of trainers you encounter! I prefer all double battles.
	- Trainer settings per trainer category: Use different randomization settings for Gym Leaders, Ace Trainers, Team Leaders, and more!
	- The Dunsparse Plague: anything can evolve into Dunspare... half of the time. Affects NPCs too!
	- Bonus Moves: add bonus moves to pokemon movesets at a level that makes sense. Can draw moves from the pokemon's egg moves or make a random choice!
	- ...And much more!

- Currently supports a small amount of Gen III ROMS (English Emerald and Fire Red v1.0), but I plan to support at least Gen IV and Gen II in the future

Originally based off of source code from Artemis251's Pokemon Emerald Randomizer (v.2.2 -- 13 April 2014) but I pivoted to C# so now its just a reference.

Another project that's been a great reference for writing this is dabomstew's Universal pokemon randomizer.

# Description

Procedural Pokemon Randomizer is a Pokemon randomizer I'm creating as a fun side project!

- This Randomizer focuses on using procedural generation and weighted random choices to create randomized ROMs that feel more natural
- Some of my favorite new features are:
	- Type-Variant Pokemon: random type-variants of pokemon with corresponding color palettes, movesets, base stats, and other modifications!
	- Intelligent trainer pokemon choices: challenge runs are more fun when you can plan for a fisherman to usually have WATER pokemon!
	- Intelligent wild pokemon choices: find pokemon where they make sense (water pokemon when fishing, electric pokemon in the power plant, etc)!
	- Reoccuring trainer logic: trainers that you see multiple times (like rivals, etc.) will raise a team that keeps members but grows and evolves over the course of the game.
	- Battle type randomization: randomize the battle type of trainers you encounter! I prefer all double battles.
	- The Dunsparse Plague: anything can evolve into Dunsparse... half of the time. Affects NPCs too!
	- Bonus Moves: add bonus moves to pokemon movesets at a level that makes sense. Can draw moves from the pokemon's egg moves or make a random choice!
	- Type-Themed villainous teams: ever wonder what it would be like if Team Aqua used Electric and Dragon pokemon?
	- Dream Team Generator: generate type-restricted or base stat total restricted teams of pokemon that will appear on the first route of the game!
	- ...And much more!

Originally based off of source code from Artemis251's Pokemon Emerald Randomizer (v.2.2 -- 13 April 2014) but I pivoted to C# so now its just a reference.
Check out their website! http://artemis251.fobby.net/downloads/emerald/

Another project that's been a great reference for writing this is dabomstew's Universal pokemon randomizer.

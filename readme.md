# Description

A Pokemon randomizer I'm creating as a fun side project!

- Currently focuses on Gen III, but I plan to support at least Gen IV and Gen II
- Heavy focus on PCG and Vanilla+ options

Originally based off of source code from Artemis251's Pokemon Emerald Randomizer (v.2.2 -- 13 April 2014) but I pivoted to C# so now its just a reference.
Check out their website! http://artemis251.fobby.net/downloads/emerald/

Another project that's been a great reference for writing this is dabomstew's Universal pokemon randomizer.

# Version (v0.2.3.5)

### Version Number Convention

1st number: release         (0 - unreleased: UI may be incomplete. Features may need to be accessed by modifying source code. 1 - released: All present feature may be accessed from a built release)

2nd number: major update    (this number will increment when a major update happens)

3rd number: minor update    (this number will increment when a minor update happens)

4th number: patch (optional)(this number will increment when a fix has been made to the code that WILL NOT change the randomizer's output except to fix a feature that wasn't working properly)

### Notes

If the first three numbers of the version number are the same, any ROM generated from the same base ROM, seed, and settings should be able to be swapped in the middle of a playthrough with no changes to any randomized values.

Any code from before 10/3/2020 is considered to be unversioned.

# Releases

I don't have an executable release yet, but I'll link the latest one here when I do.
